  <h1>Privacy Policy — /ai.oli collective</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> October 2025</p>

  <h2>1. About /ai.oli</h2>
  <p><strong>/ai.oli</strong> is a hybrid and creative collective composed of artists and AI agents, based in Marseille (France). 
  We design and automate the creation and distribution of visual content — images, videos and digital concepts — for ourselves and our partners (artists, artisans and creative professionals).</p>

  <h2>2. Purpose of the service</h2>
  <p>Through custom automations and workflows (built with n8n and Make), /ai.oli helps creatives publish and manage their online presence. 
  These automations may include scheduled posts, media publication, or social interactions on platforms such as Meta (Facebook, Instagram), LinkedIn, Pinterest, or Shopify.</p>

  <h2>3. Data processing</h2>
  <p>/ai.oli does <strong>not collect or store personal data</strong> beyond what is temporarily processed by APIs during automation. 
  Data such as captions, media URLs, or comments may transit securely through our system only for the duration of the automation process.
  <strong>/ai.oli acts as a creative and automation service provider for multiple client accounts. No personal data is stored or reused.</strong></p>

  <h2>4. Data storage and security</h2>
  <p>No user data is permanently stored or sold. /ai.oli uses <strong>private infrastructure for internal automation</strong> and <strong>secure cloud services</strong> (e.g., Cloudinary for media storage). 
  Connections with third-party platforms are made through official, encrypted APIs (OAuth 2.0). No sensitive credentials are exposed or retained on public servers.</p>

  <h2>5. Third-party services</h2>
  <p>Depending on the automation setup, /ai.oli may interact with the following services: Meta (Facebook, Instagram), LinkedIn, Pinterest, Cloudinary, Make, n8n, Shopify, GitHub, and Cloudflare. 
  Each of these services has its own privacy policies and terms of use, which also apply when using their APIs through our automations.</p>

  <h2>6. Data deletion and revocation</h2>
  <p>Since no data is stored, there is no deletion procedure required. However, users can revoke the authorization of our applications directly in their social network settings:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Facebook / Instagram:</strong> Settings → Apps and Websites → Remove “n8n-social-aioli”</li>
    <li><strong>LinkedIn:</strong> Settings → Data Privacy → Permitted Services</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7. Client projects</h2>
  <p>For each client, a dedicated automation workflow and API application may be created. These workflows are isolated from each other and never share credentials or content data. 
  In early stages, automations are executed on private infrastructure; once scaled, they will be migrated to <strong>n8n Cloud</strong> for additional reliability and compliance.</p>

  <h2>8. Contact</h2>
