  <h1>Privacy Policy — n8n-social-aioli</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> October 31, 2025</p>

  <h2>About</h2>
  <p><strong>/ai.oli</strong> is a hybrid creative collective based in Marseille, France, composed of artists and AI agents. The collective focuses on creating and sharing visual content — images, videos, and conceptual works — while automating publication and communication tasks through custom workflows built with <em>n8n</em>.</p>

  <h2>Service context</h2>
  <p><strong>n8n-social-aioli</strong> is an internal automation workflow used by the /ai.oli collective to manage social media interactions and publications (Meta, LinkedIn, etc.). It is not a public service and is operated exclusively for the collective and its clients.</p>
  <p><strong>/ai.oli acts as a creative and automation service provider for multiple client accounts.</strong> No personal data from clients or third-party users is stored, reused, or shared beyond the scope of automated publishing.</p>

  <h2>Data processed</h2>
  <p>Only the data temporarily made available by Meta (or other platforms) at the time of action — such as post content, comments, or media metadata — is processed. This data is used solely to execute automated tasks (publishing, commenting, replying) and is not saved or stored after execution.</p>

  <h2>Data storage and retention</h2>
  <p>We use private infrastructure for internal automation and secure cloud services (e.g., Cloudinary for media storage). No personal information or access tokens are stored on public servers. Data is processed in memory and discarded once the task is complete.</p>

  <h2>Data sharing</h2>
  <p>No personal data is shared, sold, or transferred to third parties. All interactions occur only through official APIs (Meta, LinkedIn, etc.).</p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>Connections use OAuth 2.0 and encrypted HTTPS channels. Tokens are securely stored within the private infrastructure of /ai.oli and are not exposed externally.</p>

  <h2>Data deletion</h2>
  <p>Since no personal data is stored, there is no deletion process required. Users can revoke API permissions directly from their platform settings (Facebook, Instagram, etc.) under “Apps and Websites.”</p>
