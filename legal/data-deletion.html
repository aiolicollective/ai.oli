  <h1>Data Deletion Policy — /ai.oli collective</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> October 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Overview</h2>
  <p><strong>/ai.oli</strong> is a hybrid and creative collective using automated workflows (“n8n-social-aioli”) to publish and manage visual content on behalf of its members and collaborators. 
  We act as a creative and automation service provider for multiple client accounts. No personal data is stored or reused.</p>

  <h2>2. Temporary data processing</h2>
  <p>All data handled by /ai.oli workflows — such as captions, media URLs, comments, or publication IDs — is processed only in memory, for the duration of the automation execution. 
  Once the task is completed, no information is saved, archived, or accessible by any third party.</p>

  <h2>3. Revoking access</h2>
  <p>Since no user data is stored, deletion requests are generally unnecessary. 
  However, if you have granted access to one of our applications (e.g., “n8n-social-aioli”) and wish to revoke it, please follow the instructions below:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Facebook / Instagram:</strong> Go to Settings → Apps and Websites → Find “n8n-social-aioli” → Remove Access.</li>
    <li><strong>LinkedIn:</strong> Settings → Data Privacy → Permitted Services → Remove “/ai.oli”.</li>
    <li><strong>Pinterest or other integrations:</strong> Revoke access directly from your account’s security or connected apps section.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Client-specific workflows</h2>
  <p>Each client automation is isolated within its own environment and API credentials. 
  If a client terminates collaboration with /ai.oli, all related workflows, access tokens, and media are deleted immediately from our private infrastructure and associated cloud services (e.g., Cloudinary).</p>

  <h2>5. Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions or wish to verify that your access or data has been fully removed, please contact us:</p>
