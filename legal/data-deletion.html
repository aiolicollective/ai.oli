  <h1>Data Deletion Policy — n8n-social-aioli</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> October 31, 2025</p>

  <h2>About</h2>
  <p><strong>n8n-social-aioli</strong> is an internal workflow operated by the /ai.oli collective to automate social media content publication and interactions across multiple client accounts.</p>
  <p><strong>/ai.oli acts as a creative and automation service provider for multiple clients.</strong> The system does not collect, retain, or share any personal data. All data is processed in memory solely to complete automation tasks.</p>

  <h2>Data deletion</h2>
  <p>As no personal data is stored, no deletion process is required. All temporary data (e.g., post IDs, tokens, captions) is automatically discarded after the workflow execution.</p>

  <h2>Revoking access</h2>
  <p>If you have connected your Facebook, Instagram, or other social accounts via our automation system and wish to revoke access:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Go to your account settings (e.g., Facebook → Settings → Apps and Websites)</li>
    <li>Find “n8n-social-aioli”</li>
    <li>Select “Remove” to revoke access permissions</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Infrastructure</h2>
  <p>We use private infrastructure for internal automation and secure cloud services (e.g., Cloudinary for media storage). No personal data is stored on public servers or shared with any third parties.</p>
